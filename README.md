# EDA - COVID19 Project

Last updated: 13-Jun-2020


Welcome to my COVID19 Exploratory Dta Anaylsis Project. In this repo, I will be saving all of my data analytics work on diverse COVID19-related datasets.


## I. Initial Task

Provide the company with an overview of COVID-19, the pandemic, and its effect across the globe.


## II. Outline for the Project
Task
My current task is general and specific in the sense that I have a wide range of angles I can pursue from one specific topic, COVID-19. I need to source data on my own and inform the company on the current situation surrounding the virus.

Let's tackle some essential questions first (most of the information below related to COVID-19 was taken from the [Government of Western Australia Department of Health latest report](https://ww2.health.wa.gov.au/~/media/Files/Corporate/general%20documents/Infectious%20diseases/PDF/Coronavirus/coronavirus-faqs.pdf#page=1)).
- **What is COVID-19?** This is a new coronavirus that was first identified in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China in December 2019. It is a new strain of coronaviruses that hasn’t previously been identified in humans. COVID-19 is closely related to SARS and in the same family of viruses as MERS.
- **What are a Coronaviruses?** "Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that can cause illness in humans and animals. Human coronavirus illnesses are generally mild such as the common cold. Some coronaviruses can cause severe diseases such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which was identified in 2002, and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), which was identified in 2012."
- **What are the symptoms?** Symptoms include shortness of breath or cough, with or without a fever. In some cases, the virus can cause severe pneumonia. From what we know now about COVID-19, the symptoms can start between 2 and 14 days from exposure to the virus.
- **What is a Pandemic?** A pandemic is defined as “an epidemic occurring worldwide, or over a very wide area, crossing international boundaries and usually affecting a large number of people”. The classical definition includes nothing about population immunity, virology or disease severity. ([WHO 2011](https://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/89/7/11-088815/en/))
- **How can it be cured?** There is no treatment available at the moment.
- **How can help decrease the spread of the virus?**
    - Self-isolation
    - Social distancing
    - Increase personal higene. Washing hands frequently and not touching one's faces.  


### 3. Data Required
Because of our company's global footprint, we will need as much data as we can get on the current situation across the globe. This means that scraping data, going to well-known sources of information such as the World Health Organization, the World Bank, Governments websites, etc., is all fair game.

Thie first dataset we will be using in this project comes from Out World in Data. [Here is the link to access that data.] (https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-data)
### c. Cleaning & Manipulation
This part will depend on the data available.
### 4. Description and Visualisation
This will depend on the data available but we will definitely want to see trends, distributions, max and min values around the peak weeks, and many averages.
### 5. Report findings
In the pipeline.
